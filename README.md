This is the raw data used to create the [family tree of operating systems](https://eylenburg.github.io/os_familytree.htm), which is rendered using gnuclad.

Some of the dates are estimates based on e.g. the years of the project website going online and being taken down. 

If anyone can contribute corrections that will be much appreciated.

Please note that some operating systems have their end date set to the year 2100 to avoid running into a bug in gnuclad.
